            "content": "<think>We are playing white and its our move. We are in an endgame since most of the pieces have come off the board. Counting the material, both sides have two rooks. Our rooks are doubled on the 7th rank on b7 and c7. Our opponent's rooks are on f8 and b3. We have 4 pawns on g2 h3 d6 and f5. Our opponent has 5 pawns on b6 c3 f7 g7 and h6. Therefore we are down a pawn in this position. Our opponent's pawn on c3 is very close to promotion however are rook on c7 is attacking it so if the pawn moves to c2, we can capture it with our c7 rook and be equal! Our strongest assets are the rooks doubled on the 7th rank and our pawn on d6. Since we are trying to get our pawn to promote d7(d6d7) seems like a logical move. Moving our king or pawns don't help in anyway and our rooks are well placed. After pawn d7 it feels like black can't stop the pawn because we are threatening rc8 pinning the black rook to the king(the black rook can't move) and we are threating d8=Q or Rxf8+ and then d8=q. Where black has to sacrifice the rook otherwise we will be up a queen. However black can play Kh7. Now logically we follow up our plan and play rc8 planning to play d8=Q next move. However black can play c2! If we take the free rook(it is not defended by the king after Kh7  then black promotes with check with c1=Q+ Now black is up a queen and we are lost. However we can simply play rbc7!! moving the rook from b7 to c7. Now if black plays c1=Q we can capture it with rxc1.if he doesnt we just play d8=Q next move. And after this we will up a full rook at 600 centipawns which gives us a win percentage of 90. To summarize the best line for us which gives us a 90% win chance is d7 kh7 rc8,c2,rbc7. To find the best move you need to think what will my opponent play otherwise we could have lost this position</think>\boxed{d7(d6d7)}"

            "content": "<think>We are playing black and it is our move. We are currently in a tactical middle game position as both sides kings are in danger and the both queens are very active. Counting the material we both have two rooks and a queen. Our opponents rooks are stacked on the f file at f1 and f6 attacking our f7 pawn. Our rooks are disconected on f8 and e6 defending our position. Our queen is very active on e3 while our oppoenets queen is also active on g2. We are down a bishop as our oponent has a bishop on c2 and we don't have one at all. However to compensate we have an extra two pawns, but since i bishop is worth 3 pawns we are down one point in material. Our pawns are on h6 f7 e4 d5 b5 and a6. Our opponent's pawns are on g5 d4 b4 and a3. If we play a random move like a5, our opponent is threating gxh6+ and qg7#. So to avoid getting checkmated we have to defend. We could play a move like h5 to avoid gxh6, but our opoenent could play bd1 attacking the pawn and we are still down a bishop. We could play rg8 so that qg7# is impossible, but our f7 pawn is then week and rxf7 is a massive threat. Therefore our only option is to capture the pawn. To do that we have two options qxg5 and hxg5. Qxg5 looks decent however our oponent can just trade queens and we our down a bishop in the endgame and we are therefore lost. hxg5 looks scary since it allows qxg5+ and our king looks like its in danger. However our queen is defending that square so our opponent can't actually capture the pawn. And when we play hxg5 we open up the h file threating rh1# since our queen controls g1. We also remove a defender of the rook on f6 threating to caputre it the only way to stop both is to either give up your queen or respond with qf2 giving the king more breathing room and defending the rook. However qf2 moves the queen of the all important h3 square allowing qh3+ and then qg4+. Now are opponent's move to not get checkmated is qg2 however now we can trade queens and now the queen stops defending the rook making it a free piece. Now we are 700 centipawns and we have a 93 percent chance to win if we didn't play this move we would only have a 30 chance to win so the move hxg5(h6g5) is very important. The winning variation is hxg5 qf2 qh3+ kg1 qg4+ qg2 qxg2 kxg2 rxf6 rxf6 kxf6. Its a long variation but it got us 60 closer to a win</think>\boxed{hxg5(h6g5)}"

            "content": "<think>We are playing white and its our move. We are only on move 13 so we are in the opening. In the opening very few pieces have been traded and moved. In the current position. Black has just captured our pawn on c4. If we capure the knight back with the bishop then he can capture the bishop with his knight meaning we lost a pawn. Sometimes in the opening pawn sacrifices can be good to open lines and allow for fast developement but here we are already developed and the loss of the c4 doesn't give many benefits. However there might be a way we can exploit the knights. If we can attack the knight on e5 somehow so it has to move than the bishop can capture the knight on c4 and we will be up a piece. one way to do this is bf4, but the knight on e5 is defended by the knight on c4 and the pawn on e6. To dislodge the knight we need to attack it with a pawn. This gives us the move f4!(f2f4). if the knight on e5 doesn't move we can capture it with a pawn gaining 2 points of material. If the knight on e5 does move saving it from the f4 pawn we can just capture the knight on c4 with our bishop since its undefended. Our win_percentage from playing c4 goes from 0% to 75% doubling our chance of winning. The winning variation for us is f4 nb6 fxe5. Be extremely careful when capturing free pieces to make sure there are no tactics like this. Likewise be aware that these tactics exist. Also if our opponent captured with the other knight this tactic would not exist, but make sure to always pounce on these oppurtunities</think>\boxed{f4(f2f4)}"

            "content": "<think>We are playing black in and endgame. Since there are only pawns on the board and all of our pawns are blocking white's pawns if we play optimally we can't lose this position. Counting the material we have 1 extra pawn We have pawwns on h6 f7 and f5 while white has pawns on h3 and g3. Since we have one extra pawn we should usually be winning this position. However our extra pawn is doubled on the f file which can sometimes counter our advantage. Since there a very few pieces we can consider all possible moves. We will first consider pawn moves. If we play f6 our opponent can respond with h4. Now if we move h5 our opponent can plaw kf4 and we have to move our king which leaves the f5 pawn hanging. If we don't play h5 the only other pawn move is f4 which loses the f5 pawn to gxf4 which forces the draw. If instead of moving our pawns we move our king the f5 pawn is undefended and we lose it. Therefore f6 is the wrong move. Another pawn move is f4 however this blunders the pawn with gxf4 and leads to a draw. The last pawn move we can make is h5. If black just moves the king to like g2. We have the brilliant move f4!. If white captures with gxf4 we capture with the king and no matter where the king moves we can win the h pawn winning us the game. If white plays ke3 trying to defend against f4 we still play f4!! sacrifcing the pawn. Now that the king has moves so far after gxf4 we can play kh4 and win the h3 pawn and later win the game by promoting the h pawn. The only other move our oppoent can play is h5+ forcing our king to move back. If we play kh6 the game is back to a draw as white can play kf4! ke5!! and go after our f7 pawn forcing our king to stay back and not target white's pawns. If we try to stop ke5 with f6 white can just take the f5 pawn. If we play kf6 after kf4 we must move. Our only two moves that don't lose the f5 pawn allow the king to go to g5 or e5 allowing it to target the f7 pawn. Therefore the only move that wins is kg6!! If white tries kf5 we either have f6 or kf6 and now we get to play ke5!!! since white must leave the f4 sqaure. This is called opposition and is a very useful tool in  pawn endgames. The move h5 takes the position from equal 50% to a forced mate which has a 100% win rate. The wining variation is h5 h4 kg6 kf4 kf6 ke3 ke5 or h5 ke3 f4 gxf4 kh4 kf2 kxh2. Both these variations allow us to promote our pawns and win the game. Note that the move kg6 also works but we must play h5 otherwise the game will end in a draw kg6 transposes into the same position. Calculating deep into endgames allowed us to find a winning move!</think>\boxed{h5(h6h5)}"

            "content": "<think>We are playing black and its our move. We are in an endgame since there are very few pieces on the board. We each have one rook and bishop. Our rook is kindof passive on the h3 square where white has there rook on b3 escorting the pawns down the board. Our bishop is extremely passive on d8 while white has a much stronger bishop on e5 controlling much of the board. Our king is also not that great on c8 as we try and stop the a and b pawns from queening. Our opponents king is very active on the f5 square. We are also down a pawn with doubled pawns on the c file on c6 and c5 and a lone pawn on h7. Our oppoenent has 4 passed pawns on a3 b5 g5 and f3 causing threats from both sides of the board. Our position is much worst then our opponent and we have a 18% chance of winning. However after our opponent played the move cxb5 we might have a change. It might seem natural to capture back with cxb5 however after cxb5 rxb5 rxf3+ke6 ra3+ rb8#. Therefore we can't allow the rook to get an open b file and allow ke6. Also the c pawn is also haning so the position is just lost after cxb5. However we don't always have to take the material back. In end games past pawns are very important and this allows us to play c4!! attacking the rook. sinc since the b5 pawn blocks the rook the rook really can only go to b4 or c3. If the rook goes to c3 we can capture the pawn on b5 now since the rook isn't on the b file and we defend our pawn on c4. If our oponent tries a4 trying to break the chain we have the move ba4!! This move forces the rook to move. If the rook stays on the c file than we are winning with b4 c3 promotion. If the rook moves to c2 we can play rxf3+ and rb3 defending our pawns. if axb5 we can first play c3 and after some trades we get a draw. If after c4 our opponent plays rb4 we have rxf3. If the king moves to g4 to attack the rook  we can play re3 attacking the bishop. If the king moves to f5 we have the tactic bxg5+ winning a pawn and getting a draw. if the bishop moves we can simply sacrifice the bishop for the pawn on g5 anyway and then the pawn on a3 and a rook and bishop can never defeat a rook and 2 pawns in an endgame forcing a draw. Therefore our oponent can only play either bf6 or bf4 to try and win. bf4 allows rc3 and now we threaten to escort the c pawn down the board since the bishop on e5 moved. After rc3 our oponent can play bxc6 threating rb8# since the b file and biship are open. Therefore we can simply play bc7 and trade bishops forcing a draw. However don't trade both bishops and rooks otherwise we lose! If bf6 we can simply play cxb5 and know that rb8# is not a threat we can play rxa3 after. In a lost position with no chance at surviving we pounced on our opponent's mistake to get a draw. It is important in chess to defend worse positions and pounce on mistakes by our opponent. Here the drawing variation is c4 rb4 rxf3+ kg4 re3 ba1 bxg5 kxg5 cxb5 rxb5 rxa3 1/2-1/2. Its important in endgames to make sure you have enough material to draw. Its also important to note that we need to think for every move and not just blindly recapture since that would have cost us the game. We went from having an 18% to win to a 50% to win. and from -300 centipawns to 0. Its important to not only look for tactics but also play good moves so we don't get into such positions.</think>\boxed{c5(c5c4)}"
